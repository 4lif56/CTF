# CAPTURE THE FLAG: AUTOMATED MATH CHALLENGE SOLVER
Welcome to my repository for solving math-based challenges during Capture The Flag (CTF) events.

## Overview
This challenge showcases the process of:

- Automating real-time arithmetic problem-solving using Python.
- Parsing and responding to rapid-fire math questions from a remote server.
- Extracting the flag after solving 100 questions correctly within a strict time limit.

## Tools Used
- `pwntools`: For interacting with the challenge server.
- Python: To handle arithmetic computations and automate responses.
