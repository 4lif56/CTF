# My Friend John - CTF Challenge

## Objective
The goal of this challenge is to recover the password for the `flag.txt` file inside the `flag.zip` file. Both files are encrypted using two different passwords.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Password Hint**: The passwords are related to personal clues.
2. **Crack the First Password**: Use tools like `John the Ripper` to brute-force or crack the password for `flag.zip`.
3. **Open `flag.zip`**: Once the password is recovered, open the `flag.zip` to reveal the `flag.txt`.
4. **Crack the Second Password**: After accessing `flag.txt`, repeat the password recovery process for the file inside. It may be a bit more challenging.

Happy hacking :3
